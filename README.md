# DressMe

DressMe allows users to store images and descriptions of their clothing items. They can be grouped as outfits or individual pieces.

# Why?

DressMe makes choosing outfits more seamless... and fun! Instead of rifling through closets and drawers, the user can simply swipe through pics to find what fits their vibe.

This is a Ruby on Rails project.
